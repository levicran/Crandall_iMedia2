<h2 style="text-align:Center; color:#6C3483;" >Why Am I Interested In Coding?</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"> At a young age I have a <strong>passion</strong> for technology. In today's society technology is <strong>changing</strong>
our world and coding is the <em>language</em> of technology.If I can understand coding I feel as if I will have the knowledge to create anything I want. 
I also <em>dream</em> of someday running my own business online and being able to code my own website vs hiring someone sounds <strong>empowering </strong>.</p>

<p>Listed Below are some of my favorite hobbies and interest:

	to our collection.</li>

<h2 style="text-align:Center; color:#A93226" >&#8606;Future Goals&#8608;</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"> My dream is to own my own online boutique. I plan to attend Kansas State University and major in Business with a minor in
Computer Science. That way I know how to be a professional with computer programming and I can run my online business successfully. Someday I would also
like to get my MBA. My online boutique would sell womens fashion. I rather have my business online because I feel as if I can have the whole world
shop my store vs local shoppers. Personally I would also like to find the love of my life when I am older and hope to start a family too. I also would
love to adopt a cat or two. </p>
